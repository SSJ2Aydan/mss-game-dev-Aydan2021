<h2 align-center>My pets</h2>
Hi. I like my pets. My cat and dog are great pets.<br>
Here is a picture of my cat and a picture of my dog.<br>
<img src="Cat.jpg" width="402" height="303"><img src="Clover.jpg" width="402" height="303">
My cat's name is Pixel and my dog's name is Clover. <br>
Pixel likes:
<li>food
  treats
  sleep
  playing
  catnip</li>
Clover likes:
<li>food
  treats
  walks
  sleep</li>
They are very similar, however Pixel hates Clover for some reason
