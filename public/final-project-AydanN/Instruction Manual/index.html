<b id="Notes">*Numpad Notation Notes</b><br>
The 236S, 214S, 22S, and 41236S attacks are named after their inputs. The S stands for special, which you press after the attack. The numbers are based off of "numpad notation." It works like this:<br>
<img src="images/NumpadNotation.jpg"><br>
Imagine a number pad, but only with the numbers 1 to 9. This is a visual representation of it. Now, imagine you are on the left of an opponent. The number 5 is neutral, you are not pressing any directions.<br> The number 2 is down, the number 6 is forward, and so on and so forth. If you were on the right of an opponent, the number pad inverts, so 6 is on the left instead of right, and so forth.
 Using this notation, there is a standardized way of saying move names. That way, people don't have to say "down, downback, back, J" or "Quarter circle back J" (though that is also occasionally used) which take much longer to spell out and say.
